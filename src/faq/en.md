## What is Traze?
Traze is a professional, free, and open-source trading tool designed for the cryptocurrency community. It helps users efficiently manage and monitor their trading activities with a focus on transparency and user control.

## Is Traze an Open Source Project?
Yes, Traze is fully open source and free to use. While it's currently designed as a browser-based application for maximum security and transparency, developers can extend it to a server-side application using frameworks like Next.js to create more powerful server-client architectures. The browser-only approach was chosen specifically to eliminate security concerns and potential scam risks.

## Traze is Free, Isn't It?
Absolutely! Traze is and will always be free to use. The only costs you'll incur are those associated with your trading infrastructure - primarily the RPC endpoint fees for quality network access. We maintain a tip wallet for users who wish to support ongoing development and appreciate the value they've gained from the tool.

## Who Created Traze?
Traze was created by a DeFi enthusiast who believes in minimizing unnecessary fees in cryptocurrency trading. The core principle is simple: traders should only pay essential costs like gas fees, not extra platform charges. This philosophy drove the development of a tool that helps users avoid various types of additional fees.

## Does Traze Only Work on pump.fun?
Currently, yes. I have a development roadmap that includes plans to support additional exchanges. While I'm expanding the exchange coverage, Traze will remain focused exclusively on the Solana ecosystem to ensure optimal performance and reliability.

## How Do I Get Started?

1. Configure your RPC endpoints in the settings panel
2. Create a new swarm or import your existing wallets
3. Select your desired trading token
4. Begin monitoring and executing trades

## Is it Safe to Use?
Traze is built with security as its top priority. It operates exclusively in your browser and only connects to RPC endpoints that you explicitly configure. Your private keys are stored temporarily in local browser memory and are never transmitted to any external servers. For additional security, all key data is automatically cleared when you close or refresh the page. While I prioritize security, I always recommend exercising caution and never sharing your private keys with anyone.
